# README

This is the Git repository for the course "Predictive Maintenance" in WS 2024/25 containing slides, JupyterNotebooks, and a file to set up your conda environment. You find the most recent files here - the links in ELO also redirect to this repository.

## Setup
1. Clone this repo
1. Generate a `.gitignore`-file in the main folder of this repo containing `edited/` in the first line.
1. If you want to have recent files, use the `git pull` command - or download the file you want manually. I try to push changes directly after our sessions.

If you do not create an `.gitignore`-file, then you get the changes of the example Notebooks I made recently during the sessions. If you do create an `.gitignore`-file, then you can use the `edited`-folders as your working directories.

Please use the `PRM.yml` for your conda environment. If this does not work, please use the `requirements.txt` by typing `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
