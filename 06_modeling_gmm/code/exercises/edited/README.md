# README
This folder is left empty on purpose. Copy the JupyterNotebooks from raw/ into edited/. Afterwards, you can edit the files in the edited/ folder. Files in raw/ shall be left untouched.
After initial cloning of the repo, you shall create an `.gitignore`-file with `edited/` in the first line. This `.gitignore`-file has to be in the root folder of this repo.
